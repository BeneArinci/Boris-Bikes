# Boris-Bikes
London's Boris Bikes (well, 'Santander Cycles') are awesome.
Anyone can hire out a bike and ride it around London.
Let's go back several years, to the days when there were no Boris Bikes.
They want you to build a program that will emulate all the docking stations,
bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required to make their dream a reality.
